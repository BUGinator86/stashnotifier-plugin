Stash Build Reporter Plugin for Jenkins
=======================================

This Jenkins plugin notifies Stash of build results. Failed or
successful builds will show up as little icons in the Stash web 
interface in commit logs. Clicking on such an icon will take the 
user to the specific build.

This plugin uses the 
[Atlassian Stash Build status REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/latest/stash-build-integration-rest.html)
which was introduced with Stash 2.1.
